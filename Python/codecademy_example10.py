#Create a function named always_false() that has one parameter named num.

#Using an if statement, your variable num, and the operators >, and <, make it so your function will return False no matter what number is stored in num.

#An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

def always_false(num):
  if (num > 0 and num < 0):
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False
